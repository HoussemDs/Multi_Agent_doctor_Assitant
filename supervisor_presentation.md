## Patient Examples

### John Smith (Normal Patient)

```
Patient Data → DataProcessor → NormalPatientAgent → Health Report
```

**Key Points:**
- 35-year-old male with normal vital signs
- No symptoms, only seasonal allergies
- Processed by Normal Patient Agent
- Received preventive care recommendations
- No doctor consultation needed

### Robert Davis (Heart Patient)

```
Patient Data → DataProcessor → HeartPatientAgent → Cardiologist → Treatment Plan → Cardiac Care Plan
```

## Technical Implementation

- **Language Models**: Each agent has its own LLM instance (Groq API)
- **Agent Communication**: Structured data exchange between agents
- **Patient Categorization**: Rules-based system in DataProcessor
- **Output**: Markdown files with comprehensive patient reports

## Results

The system successfully processed two patients:

1. **John Smith**: Generated a health report with preventive care recommendations
2. **Robert Davis**: Generated a comprehensive cardiac care plan with specialist input

All reports were saved as markdown files in the `output` directory.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more specialized agents for different medical conditions
2. Implement a feedback loop for continuous improvement
3. Integrate with electronic health record systems
4. Add a patient-facing interface for direct interaction

## Conclusion

The Agentic Doctor System demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate to provide appropriate medical care recommendations based on patient data. The system successfully categorizes patients, routes them to the right specialists, and generates comprehensive care plans.
